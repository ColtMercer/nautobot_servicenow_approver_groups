# ServiceNow Groups Nautobot App - Development Roadmap

## Current Status: ✅ Basic Plugin Loading Working

### ✅ Completed Steps

1. **Initial Setup**
   - ✅ Created basic Nautobot app structure
   - ✅ Set up Docker development environment
   - ✅ Fixed Docker configuration and permissions
   - ✅ Resolved container startup issues

2. **Database & Models**
   - ✅ Created ServiceNowGroup model with proper Nautobot base classes
   - ✅ Implemented device association logic
   - ✅ Created and applied database migrations
   - ✅ Fixed migration dependency issues

3. **Synthetic Data Generation**
   - ✅ Created hierarchical location structure (regions, countries, sites)
   - ✅ Generated 32 locations with proper hierarchy
   - ✅ Created manufacturers, device types, and device roles
   - ✅ Generated 604 devices with proper naming conventions
   - ✅ Validated device assignments and naming standards

4. **Plugin Architecture Refactor**
   - ✅ Identified circular import issues with Django-style approach
   - ✅ Refactored to use proper Nautobot base classes:
     - ✅ `NautobotModelViewSet` for API views
     - ✅ `NautobotModelSerializer` for API serializers
     - ✅ `NautobotFilterSet` for filtering
     - ✅ `NautobotModelForm` for forms
   - ✅ Simplified plugin configuration to avoid circular imports
   - ✅ Plugin now loads successfully without startup errors

### 🔄 Current State

- **Plugin Status**: ✅ Loaded and running
- **Nautobot Status**: ✅ Running and healthy
- **Database**: ✅ Connected and migrated
- **API**: ✅ Enabled and functional
- **UI**: ✅ Enabled with views and navigation
- **Template Content**: ✅ Injected using proper TemplateExtension

### 📋 Next Steps (Priority Order)

#### Phase 1: Restore Basic Functionality
1. **Test Template Content Injection**
   - [x] Verify device detail page shows ServiceNow Groups section
   - [x] Test with existing devices or create test devices
   - [x] Ensure template renders correctly

2. **Restore API Functionality**
   - [x] Fix circular import issues in API views
   - [x] Test ServiceNow Group CRUD operations via API
   - [x] Verify device association logic works
   - [x] Test API endpoints with authentication

3. **Add Basic UI Views**
   - [x] Create simple Django views (not NautobotUIViewSet)
   - [x] Add list, detail, create, edit, delete views
   - [x] Create basic templates for each view
   - [x] Test UI functionality

#### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
4. **Add Navigation Menu**
   - [x] Configure navigation menu items
   - [x] Add proper permissions
   - [x] Test menu integration

5. **Advanced UI Features**
   - [x] Implement NautobotUIViewSet properly
   - [x] Add tables, filters, and forms
   - [x] Add bulk operations
   - [x] Add search and filtering

6. **Device Integration**
   - [ ] Test device association logic
   - [ ] Add device assignment UI
   - [ ] Implement dynamic group integration
   - [ ] Add location-based assignment

#### Phase 3: Production Features
7. **Testing & Validation**
   - [ ] Write comprehensive tests
   - [ ] Test with real ServiceNow integration
   - [ ] Performance testing
   - [ ] Security validation

8. **Documentation & Cleanup**
   - [ ] Update developer guide
   - [ ] Create user documentation
   - [ ] Add API documentation
   - [ ] Clean up code and remove temporary workarounds

9. **Open Source Preparation**
   - [ ] Add proper licensing
   - [ ] Create contribution guidelines
   - [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline
   - [ ] Prepare for GitHub release

### 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Circular Import Issues**: API and UI views cause circular imports when using Nautobot base classes
2. **No Devices**: System currently has no devices to test with
3. **Template Testing**: Template content injection not yet verified

### 🎯 Success Criteria

- [ ] Plugin loads without errors
- [ ] API endpoints work correctly
- [ ] UI is accessible and functional
- [ ] Device association logic works
- [ ] Template content displays on device pages
- [ ] All CRUD operations work
- [ ] Navigation menu is accessible

### 📝 Notes

- The refactor to use proper Nautobot base classes was successful
- Plugin now loads without startup errors
- Need to carefully reintroduce API and UI functionality to avoid circular imports
- Consider using simpler Django views initially, then upgrading to NautobotUIViewSet later
- Template content injection should be tested first as it's the simplest feature
